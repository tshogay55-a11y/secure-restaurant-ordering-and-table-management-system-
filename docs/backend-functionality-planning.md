# Backend Functionality Planning

## Purpose
This document outlines the planned backend functionality for the Secure Restaurant Ordering and Table Management System. It defines the major backend operations and explains how the system should process login, menu display, order placement, table booking, payment handling, and confirmation response.

---

## Main Backend Functions

The main backend functions planned for the system are:

1. User Login
2. Display Menu
3. Place Order
4. Table Booking
5. Payment Processing
6. Confirmation Response

These functions represent the core backend operations required to support the restaurant system.

## 1. User Login

### Purpose
The user login function is responsible for verifying the identity of the user and allowing secure access to the system.

### Input
- Email or username
- Password

### Backend Steps
1. Receive login request from the frontend.
2. Validate that the email/username and password fields are not empty.
3. Search the database for the matching user account.
4. Compare the entered password with the securely stored password (hashed).
7. If the credentials are correct, generate a session or authentication token.
8. Assign the correct role for the user such as customer, staff, or manager.
9. Send a success response back to the frontend.
10. If the login fails, send an error message indicating invalid credentials.

### Output
- Login success response
- User authentication token or session
- Error message if credentials are invalid

---

## 2. Display Menu

### Purpose
The display menu function retrieves the list of available food and beverage items from the database and sends it to the frontend.

### Input
- User request to load menu

### Backend Steps
1. Receive menu request from the frontend.
2. Query the database for all menu items.
3. Check which items are currently available.
4. Organize menu items by category if required.
5. Prepare the menu data for response.
6. Send the menu list to the frontend.

### Output
- Available menu items
- Item details such as name, category, price, and availability

## 3. Place Order

### Purpose
The place order function allows the customer to submit selected menu items and create an order record in the system.

### Input
- User ID
- Selected menu items
- Quantity of each item
- Special instructions if any

### Backend Steps
1. Receive order request from the frontend.
2. Validate that the selected menu items exist in the database.
3. Check whether the selected items are available.
4. Calculate the total order amount.
5. Create a new order record in the database.
6. Save all selected order items linked to the order record.
7. Set order status as pending or confirmed.
8. Return an order summary and order ID to the frontend.

### Output
- Order confirmation
- Order ID
- Total order amount
- Error message if items are unavailable

---

## 4. Table Booking

### Purpose
The table booking function allows customers to reserve a table for a selected date and time.

### Input
- Customer ID or name
- Booking date
- Booking time
- Number of guests

### Backend Steps
1. Receive booking request from the frontend.
2. Validate that all booking details are provided.
3. Check table availability for the requested date and time.
4. Match the booking with a suitable available table.
5. Create a booking record in the database.
6. Update the selected table status as reserved or booked.
7. Send booking confirmation to the frontend.
8. If no table is available, send an unavailable message.

### Output
- Booking confirmation
- Booking ID
- Reserved table information
- Error message if table is unavailable

---

## 5. Payment Processing

### Purpose
The payment processing function handles secure customer payment for the placed order.

### Input
- Order ID
- Payment amount
- Payment method

### Backend Steps
1. Receive payment request from the frontend.
2. Validate the order ID and payment amount.
3. Confirm that the order exists and is ready for payment.
4. Send payment details to the payment gateway.
5. Wait for the payment gateway response.
6. If payment is successful, update the payment record in the database.
7. Update the order status as paid.
8. Send payment success response to the frontend.
9. If payment fails, send an error response.

### Output
- Payment success confirmation
- Payment transaction status
- Error message if payment fails

---

## 6. Confirmation Response

### Purpose
The confirmation response function provides the final response to the user after successful completion of order, booking, and payment processes.

### Backend Steps
1. Collect final order details from the database.
2. Collect booking information if table reservation was made.
3. Collect payment confirmation details.
4. Generate a confirmation message or receipt.
5. Send the confirmation response to the frontend.
6. Optionally trigger email or notification confirmation.

### Output
- Final confirmation message
- Order summary
- Receipt or booking confirmation

---

## Overall Backend Workflow

The overall planned backend workflow of the system is as follows:

1. User submits login details.
2. Backend verifies user credentials.
3. User requests the menu.
4. Backend retrieves menu items from the database.
5. User selects food items and places an order.
6. Backend validates the order and stores it in the database.
7. User submits a table booking request if reservation is required.
8. Backend checks table availability and creates a booking record.
9. User proceeds to payment.
10. Backend processes payment through the payment gateway.
11. Payment status is updated in the database.
12. Backend sends a final confirmation response to the user.

## Planned Security Features

The backend system will include the following security features:

- User authentication using login credentials
- Password protection and secure password handling
- Role-Based Access Control (Admin, Staff, Customer)
- Input validation to prevent SQL injection and malicious inputs
- Secure session or token-based authentication (JWT)
- Data encryption using HTTPS/TLS
- Secure payment processing using trusted payment gateway (Stripe)
- Error handling that does not expose sensitive system information

 ---

 ## Relationship with Data Entities

The backend functions interact with the following data entities:

- User → used in login and authentication
- Menu → used in displaying menu items
- Order → used in order placement and tracking
- TableBooking → used in reservation system
- Payment → used in payment processing

Each backend function retrieves or updates data from these entities to ensure system functionality.

---

## Notes for Development

- The backend should validate all user input before processing requests.
- Authentication and role-based access control should be included for security.
- Database updates should be handled carefully to maintain consistency.
- Payment handling should use secure integration with the payment gateway.
- Confirmation responses should clearly inform the user of successful or failed actions.

---

## Conclusion

This backend functionality planning provides a clear overview of what the backend should do in the Secure Restaurant Ordering and Table Management System. The identified functions and workflows will guide the future development and implementation of backend modules for authentication, menu management, ordering, booking, payment, and confirmation.
